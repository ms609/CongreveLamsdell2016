#'  Contains the 100 simulated matrices generated by Congreve & Lamsdell (2016) using a
#'  heterogeneous Markov-k model, generated from the \link{clReferenceTree} topology, with
#'  all branches sharing an equal length.

#' Congreve and Lamsdell tree distances
#'
#' Distance of CL trees from generative tree.
#'
#' For each of the 100 matrices generated by Congreve & Lamsdell (2016), I conducted
#' phylogenetic analysis under different methods:
#'
#' \itemize{
#' \item{`markov`: }{Using the Markov K model in MrBayes.}
#' \item{`equal`: }{Using equal weights in TNT.}
#' \item{`implied1`, `implied2`, `implied3`, `implied5`, `implied10`: }{Using implied weights in TNT,
#'   with the concavity constant (_k_) set to 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10}
#' \item{`impliedC`: }{By taking the strict *c*onsensus of all trees recovered by implied
#' weights parsimony analysis under the _k_ values 2, 3, 5 and 10 (but not 1).}
#' }
#'
#' For each analysis, I recorded the strict consensus of all optimal trees, and
#' also the consensus of trees that were suboptimal by a specified degree.
#'
#' I then calculated, of the total number of quartets or partitions that were
#' resolved in the reference tree, how many were the *s*ame or *d*ifferent in
#' the tree that resulted from the phylogenetic analysis, and how many were
#' not resolved in this tree (*r2*).
#'
#' The data object contains a list whose elements are named after the methods,
#' as listed above.
#'
#' Each list entry is a three-dimensional array, whose dimensions are:
#'   1.  The suboptimality of the tree.  Different measures of node
#'   support are employed:
#'     * `Mkv`: Posterior probabilities, at 2.5% intervals (50%, 52.5%, ...
#'      97.5%, 100%).
#'     * `Brem`: Bremer supports: the consensus of all trees that are
#'     (equal weights) 0, 1, .... 19, 20 steps less optimal than the optimal
#'  tree (implied weights: the consensus of all trees that are 0.73^(19:0)
#' less optimal than the optimal tree).
#'     * `Boot`: Bootstrap supports.
#'     * `Jack`: Jackknife supports.
#'   2.  The number of quartets or partitions in total, the same, different, resolved
#'  in the estimated tree but not the generative tree (= 0), resolved in the
#'  generative tree but not the estimated tree
#'   3.  The number of the matrix, from 1 to 100.
